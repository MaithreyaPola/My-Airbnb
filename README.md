# My-Airbnb

Developed a dynamic campsite review web application using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap to streamline campsite creation, management, and reviews. Implemented secure user authentication with PassportJS, and utilized jQuery and DOM Manipulation for seamless user interactions.

Integrated Google Maps API for visual context and enhanced app's functionality with MongoDB for efficient storage of campgrounds, comments, and reviews. Leveraged Node.js and Express.js to establish a robust CRUD system, ensuring easy data manipulation.

Additionally, incorporated unique features like integrated Google Ads to support the application's user-friendly registration, login, and Admin role functionalities. Deployed the project on Heroku and AWS to ensure efficient web service delivery.
